# Kidney-Exchange-Model

The purpose of this exploration is to work through classical operations research problem - Kidney Exchange and compute the determinants in the linear programming model. 

It would be interesting to see if there is a correlation between the determinants and other more ‘interpretable’ properties of the problem. 

For instance, maybe the determinant is correlated in a specific way with the number of facilities and the connections between potential locations.
